# üìö‚úç Go Wiki

### Motivation
I have used WorldAnvil and Fandom; both are fantastic in their own right, and offer comprehensive,
online solutions for "The Wiki" we often need when assembling complex universes. 

However, both come with challenges: 
* WorldAnvil's development is slow and the UI is **cumbersome**. It is **paid**.
* Fandom feels great as a user - it is tested, and the premier option in the space. However Fandom Wiki SETUP is **far from intuitive**.
  * Additionally, it lacks the ability to restrict access to certain pages or groups of pages based on user roles.

I've decided to build a third option which resolves these shortcomings.

### Docs
* View [User Guide](./docs/user/index.md)
* View [Developer Documentation](./docs/developer/index.md)
* View [API Documentation](./docs/api/index.md)

*Initial wiki built with guidance from the [Go Wiki Tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/)*
